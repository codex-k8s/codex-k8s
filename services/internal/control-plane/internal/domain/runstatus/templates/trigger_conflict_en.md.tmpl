### ⚠️ Trigger Label Conflict

Label `{{ .TriggerLabel }}` was added, but the Issue already contains other `run:*` trigger labels.

Conflicting labels:
{{- range .ConflictingLabels }}
- `{{ . }}`
{{- end }}

How to fix:
1. Remove conflicting labels.
2. Keep only one valid trigger label for the current stage.
3. Re-run by adding the chosen `run:*` label again on the Issue (or on PR if the run was triggered from PR context).
